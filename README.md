# Blink
blink is a big data computing framework, based on the idea that GPU computing might be neat for churning through data.'
currently setting everything up, and learning cuda as i go.

## Requirements
CUDA  
A CUDA compatible GPU.i'll test wether virtualising an AMD gpu is even possible, probably not tho. If im feeling crazy i might just try my best to write a vulkan version.  
nvcc  
C/C++ compiler compatible with CUDA  
python 2.7  
patience
