blink is a big data computing framework, based on the idea that GPU computing might be neat for churning through data.'
currently setting everything up, and learning cuda as i go.

## Requirements
CUDA  
A CUDA compatible GPU. i'll test wether virtualising an AMD gpu is even feasable. probably not tho.  
nvcc  
C/C++ compiler compatible with CUDA  
python 2.7 //will be updated to python 3.6 in the near future!  
patience
